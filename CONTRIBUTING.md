##  Pull Requests

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Click "Fork" on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/universal-knowledge-assistant.git
   cd universal-knowledge-assistant
   ```

2. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```

3. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Development Guidelines

#### Code Style
- **Python**: Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)
- **Docstrings**: Use triple-quoted strings for functions
- **Comments**: Explain *why*, not *what*
- **Naming**: Use descriptive variable names

```python
# Good
def calculate_semantic_similarity(query: str, document: str) -> float:
    """
    Calculate similarity between query and document using embeddings.
    
    Args:
        query: User's search query
        document: Document text to compare against
        
    Returns:
        Similarity score between 0.0 and 1.0
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass

# Avoid
def calc(q, d):  # Unclear naming
    x = something()  # No documentation
    return x
```

#### Testing
- **Test your changes** - Ensure nothing breaks
- **Add tests** - For new features when possible
- **Manual testing** - Run the GUI and verify behavior

```bash
# Run the app to test manually
python gui_assistant.py

# Run the setup wizard
python first_run_setup.pyw
```

#### Commits
- **Atomic commits** - One logical change per commit
- **Clear messages** - Describe what and why

```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "Add support for PDF indexing in ChromaDB"
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve Ollama connection timeout on slow networks"
git commit -m "Docs: Update setup guide with macOS instructions"

# Avoid
git commit -m "fixes"
git commit -m "update stuff"
```
