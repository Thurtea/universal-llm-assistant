# Security Policy

##  Our Commitment to Security

Universal Knowledge Assistant is designed with privacy and security as core principles. All processing happens locally on your machine, with no data transmitted to external servers.

##  Security Features

### Local-First Architecture
-  **No Cloud Services** - All AI processing occurs on your local machine
-  **No API Keys Required** - No external service authentication needed
-  **No Data Transmission** - Your data never leaves your computer
-  **No Telemetry** - Zero tracking or analytics

### Data Privacy
-  **HIPAA-Safe** - Suitable for sensitive medical records
-  **Confidential Documents** - Safe for legal, financial, or proprietary data
-  **Offline Operation** - Works without internet connection (after initial setup)
-  **User-Controlled Storage** - All data stored in directories you specify

### Dependencies Security
We use well-established, actively maintained open-source libraries:
- Ollama (local LLM runtime)
- ChromaDB (vector database)
- CustomTkinter (GUI framework)
- Official Python packages from PyPI

##  Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security issues seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

### **Please DO:**
1. **Email** security concerns to: `security@yourproject.com` (replace with your email)
2. **Include** detailed steps to reproduce the issue
3. **Provide** your Python version, OS, and package versions
4. **Allow** us reasonable time to address the issue before public disclosure

### **Please DON'T:**
-  Open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
-  Disclose the vulnerability publicly before we've had a chance to fix it
-  Exploit the vulnerability beyond what's necessary for demonstration

##  Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   |  Yes             |
| < 1.0   |  No (beta)       |

##  Security Best Practices

### For Users:

1. **Keep Python Updated**
   ```bash
   python --version  # Should be 3.8 or higher
   ```

2. **Update Dependencies Regularly**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Verify Ollama Downloads**
   - Only download Ollama from official sources: https://ollama.ai
   - Verify checksums when provided

4. **Secure Your Config**
   - `config.yaml` may contain sensitive paths
   - Don't commit `config.yaml` to public repositories
   - Use `.gitignore` to exclude it (already configured)

5. **Review Indexed Data**
   - Be aware of what data you're indexing
   - `chroma_db/` contains embeddings of your knowledge base
   - Delete `chroma_db/` to remove all indexed data

### For Developers:

1. **Code Reviews**
   - All pull requests require review before merging
   - Focus on security implications of changes

2. **Dependency Auditing**
   ```bash
   pip-audit  # Install with: pip install pip-audit
   ```

3. **Static Analysis**
   ```bash
   bandit -r .  # Install with: pip install bandit
   ```

##  Known Limitations

1. **Local Model Security**
   - AI models from Ollama are run with your user permissions
   - Models can access files your user account can access
   - Review Ollama's security documentation

2. **File System Access**
   - The application needs read access to your knowledge base
   - Ensure proper file permissions on sensitive directories

3. **Python Package Trust**
   - We rely on PyPI packages
   - Regularly update to receive security patches
   - Consider using virtual environments to isolate dependencies
